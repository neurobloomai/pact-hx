"""
PACT Goal Manager - Ethically-Guided Objective Setting

The Goal Manager establishes and manages objectives that align with both user needs
and ethical principles, creating a framework for purposeful, value-driven collaboration.

Key Responsibilities:
- Ethically-guided goal formulation and validation
- Goal prioritization based on value alignment and context
- Dynamic goal adaptation as situations and needs evolve
- Goal progress tracking and outcome assessment
- Multi-stakeholder goal balancing (user, AI, society)
- Goal conflict detection and resolution

Integration Points:
- Receives contextual intelligence from Context Manager for smarter goal setting
- Validates all goals through Value Alignment Manager for ethical compliance
- Directs Attention Manager toward goal-relevant focus areas
- Guides Memory Manager on goal-relevant information retention
- Coordinates with other primitives for goal achievement

Architecture:
- GoalFormulator: Creates and validates new objectives
- GoalPrioritizer: Ranks goals by importance and ethical alignment
- GoalTracker: Monitors progress and adaptation needs
- GoalResolver: Handles goal conflicts and trade-offs

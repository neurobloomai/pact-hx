- ⚡ **Real-time notifications** for adaptations
- 🎯 **Synchronized data** across all components

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**"Connection refused" errors:**
```bash
# Check if all servers are running:
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Creative Synthesis API
curl http://localhost:3000/health  # Integration Engine  
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health  # Demo Server
```

**WebSocket connection failures:**
```bash
# Check browser console for WebSocket errors
# Ensure all components use correct ports
```

**No adaptations triggering:**
```javascript
// Lower thresholds for testing in demo.html:
adaptationThreshold: 0.5  // Easier to trigger
```

**Teacher dashboard not updating:**
```bash
# Verify WebSocket connection to Integration Engine
# Check teacher_dashboard.html console for errors
```
